      <h2>Life of a Madagascar Penguin</h2>
      <div class="image-with-text">

        <p>The Madagascar penguin, scientifically known as the Humboldt penguin or Spheniscus humboldti, is a
          fascinating species of penguin found along the coasts of Peru and Chile in South America. These charismatic
          birds have also established a small population in the Galapagos Islands. Here's a brief description of the
          Madagascar penguin in 250 words:

          The Madagascar penguin is a medium-sized penguin, standing at around 18 to 24 inches tall and weighing
          approximately 8 to 13 pounds. They have a distinctive appearance, with a black back and head, white chest, and
          a broad band of black across their chest and upper belly. Their eyes are encircled by a pink patch of bare
          skin, which adds to their unique charm.

          These penguins are highly adapted for life in the water. They possess streamlined bodies and strong,
          paddle-like wings that enable them to swim swiftly and navigate underwater with agility. Their diet primarily
          consists of fish, such as anchovies and sardines, which they catch by diving deep into the ocean.

          Unlike some other penguin species, the Madagascar penguins do not build nests. Instead, they dig burrows in
          guano-rich soil or find natural cavities to lay their eggs. They usually breed in large colonies, where they
          engage in elaborate courtship rituals and exhibit strong pair bonding.

          Conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of the Madagascar penguins. They face numerous threats,
          including overfishing, habitat degradation, and climate change, which impact their food sources and nesting
          sites. Several protected areas have been established to safeguard their habitats, and conservation
          organizations work to monitor and protect their populations.

          In conclusion, the Madagascar penguin is an enchanting bird with its distinctive markings and playful nature.
          As a species facing conservation challenges, it reminds us of the importance of preserving their natural
          habitats and raising awareness about the fragile ecosystems they rely on.
